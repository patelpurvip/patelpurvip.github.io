    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>I am a lawyer by training and work in the international humanitarian sector, and I had (until the end of last year) been working for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  I am now time to do training in data analytics and technologies that can help improve protection/humanitarian monitoring in the humanitarian sector. (Python programming, SQL, dashboard creation, drone technologies, etc.)</p>
    <p>Prior to law school, I worked in non-profit development and fundraising in the Chicago area, both with grants and individual giving, and I am also a licensed massage therapist in the state of Illinos. My family is of Indian origin with close ties to India, and I am from the United States (Chicago area). I have lived in Latin America for the majority of the last 7 years, primarily in Nicaragua, Ecuador, and Mexico.</p>
